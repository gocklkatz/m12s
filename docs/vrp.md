# Information about Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

## Single Depot VRP

- Single Depot (D)
- Distance matrix
- Set of customers
- Set of vehicles

### Case 1: no quantity requirement, no capacity constraint

- Problem formulation 1: 2 vehicles, 1 depot, 6 customer nodes. Which customer is in which vehicle route and in what order so the total distance traveled by both vehicles is minimized?
- Vehicle route starts and ends in depot
- Feasible solution (e.g. d-3-4-5-d)
- Allocation problem + routing problem

### Case 2: customers quantity requirements and vehicles capacity constrains

- ...
